# Jarvis Personal Assistant
 
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Jarvis Virtual Assistant! 💻🤖
I've developed a personal AI assistant using Python that can:
🎤 Voice Commands: Jarvis listens for commands using speech recognition. 🌐 Web Browsing: Open websites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook seamlessly. 
📰 News Fetching: Get the latest headlines across various categories like business, sports, and entertainment with real-time updates via the NewsAPI. 🎶 Music Playback: Plays songs from a personalized music library. 💬 AI Conversations: Integrated OpenAI’s GPT model for conversational responses to any prompt!
This project combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, API integration, and automation—and it's just the beginning! I'm continually working on refining its features to make the assistant more versatile.
Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat about AI development or share ideas for further improvement!
